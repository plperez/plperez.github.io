## About Me

I am passionate about leveraging data analytics and machine learning to tackle complex scientific challenges in chemistry, engineering, and beyond. My background spans a Bachelor of Science in Chemistry from the Universidad Central de Venezuela and a PhD in Fuel Science from Penn State. Currently, I work as R&D Manager at Halliburton Multi-Chem in Houston, Texas.

This blog is a space where I share my projects and insights, exploring how modern data science techniques can be used to clean, visualize, and analyze scientific data. I enjoy uncovering structure-property relationships, solving real-world problems, and advancing our understanding of chemical and engineering systems through data-driven approaches.

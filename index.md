## Welcome to my blog

This personal blog showcases my data science projects, mostly focused around the use of statistical methods and machine learning to science and engineering applications. Although I cannot call myself a Data Scientist in my current job, I use data science tools extensively in my job to make things better, faster, or more efficiently. A bit about me:

* Bachelor of Science in Chemistry, from the Universidad Central de Venezuela (Caracas, Venezuela).
* PhD in Fuel Science, from the Pennsylvania State University (University Park, PA, USA).
* Currently a Senior Engineer at SUEZ Water Technology & Solutions (Tomball, TX, USA). (**Disclaimer**: This is a personal blog, and in no way my opinions, conclusions, and discussions, are endorsed by my employer--and viceversa).

Here, you will find projects and my attempts to solve problems using data science tools, regarding:

* Data cleaning, data consolidation, and data tidying.
* Improved visualization of scientific data.
* Use of statistical models, or machine learning models to understand structure-property relationships of hydrocarbon fuels, and chemical compounds.

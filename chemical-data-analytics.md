# Chemical Data Science: A Practical Introduction with Python
"Chemical Data Science" is a recognized field that combines the principles of chemistry with data science techniques. It's essentially the application of data analysis, machine learning, and computational methods to solve problems in chemistry and related fields. 

## What Do We Mean by “Chemical Data Science”?
The established field that merges chemistry with computer science is known as Cheminformatics. Cheminformatics focuses heavily on molecular representation, algorithms, and predictive modeling for applications such as drug discovery, bioactivity analysis, and structure–property relationships. It’s a specialized domain with decades of academic research and well-developed tools like RDKit, ChEMBL, and PubChem.

In this blog, however, I’ll often use the term Chemical Data Analytics. By this I mean the application of general data science techniques—Python, SQL, Excel, visualization, and machine learning—to chemical and process-related datasets. The scope is broader than cheminformatics alone: not just molecules, but also laboratory measurements, safety incident records, and industrial process data.

My aim is to make chemistry more accessible through modern data science workflows—cleaning data, visualizing trends, asking practical questions, and sharing insights. Think of Chemical Data Analytics as a hands-on, applied approach that complements cheminformatics and brings chemical data into the wider world of analytics.
